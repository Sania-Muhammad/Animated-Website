# Animated-Website
HTML: This sets up a basic webpage with a button inside a container. The link tag in the head section links the CSS file for styling.

CSS:

Basic Reset: Resets margin and padding and sets the height of the html and body to 100% to ensure full-height layout.
Container: Centers the button both horizontally and vertically in the viewport.
Button Styles: Styles the button with padding, font size, color, background color, border radius, and other properties.
Transition and Hover Effects: Uses transition for smooth animations and :hover for the color change and scaling effect when the button is hovered over.
